The normal variant mostly acts like an iron sword until it is used near a blood altar. When used to harm mobs near a blood altar an amount of $(blood)LP$() will be generated based off the amount of damage you deal to the mob(s) in question, this also respects the $(blood)LP$() multipliers from blood magics config. By default the item hase a 1x multiplier to $(blood)LP$() generated but this can be changed in the config."
